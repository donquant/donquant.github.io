message: "The coronavirus pandemic has unnatural universities to lash to interval learning. reliable essay writing service <a href=http://goodthesisstatementsdsa.com/>writing a good thesis</a> essay editing service recommend. \r\nBut what is happening now can be called an crisis delivery of content to listeners in isolation . A lot of academies  and the professors themselves were not ready for the teach online. According to a 2019 HSE study, University educators with an academic degree rate their level of proficiency in remote technologies at 3.2 points out of five. One in four persons has never used remote video services to participate in webinars or video conferences in the past three years. \r\nBut  teachers are not required to own online studying technologies. They were simply not ready for this, although education and its unique methods are the main function of academies. Try to oblige the surgeon to do their work in self-isolation. Let him explain to the patient via Skype how to remove his appendicitis. It sounds strange. Thus, the resourcefulness with which educators adapt to the remote format is commendable. \r\n \r\nSome of the time it gets funny. Colleagues from regional academies said that some teachers asked to write abstracts by hand and send them scans for verification.Nowadays, people communicate remotely in real time thanks to new digital technologies, students can \"raise their hands\" with only one button, they can write with a finger on a tablet as on a blackboard, and they are told: \"Please write a handwritten abstract and send the scan.\" Or, for example, this case: a physical education professor asked students to shoot five-minute videos where they make physical exercises. In spite of the fact that remote physical education training can be more originative, for example, you can select of ready-made videos on YouTube, find checklists in the popular domain, and teach them to play sports at home, while you can't go anywhere anywhere. \r\n \r\nUniversity professors are faced with a lack of guidance and problems in dealing with organizational matters. Someone conduct classes on Skype, some of them -in Zoom, someone only sends lectures to WhatsApp. Some educators record lectures on a webcam and send them to their students. The quality of such materials is very low, and it is hard to perceive them. At least because the videos on YouTube, which students are used to, is shot and edited professionally and the viewer is spoiled by the quality of video materials. \r\nThere are also difficulties with monitoring attendance. Some educators ask you to put a \" + \" in the chat, others require  you to turn on Webcams and take screenshots of students. Against the background of all the misunderstandings and problems, one element of academic life remains unchanged - assessment. Students don't get an educational experience on campus, but they will get grades, even formal ones. \r\n<a href=http://goodthesisstatementsdsa.com/>online thesis</a> \r\nLearning online from home does not have these disadvantages, because it is based on a carefully designed learning process in an electronic information and educational environment. Teachers have instructions, manuals, memos,checklists, templates for emails and notifications, and even presentations. Everything is thought out here-from the screen saver before the lesson to the slide with homework."
