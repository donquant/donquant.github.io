message: "When i download historical data from yahoo finance , i get different adjusted price than yours. Is your adjusted price has dividend adjusted back in as well?\r\n\r\nFor real simulation, should we keep dividend in cash and reinvest when buy/sell?\r\n\r\nAlso from simulation no matter what time I start ( after 2008), SPY always catch up to GEM as GEM always miss the SPY rebound, is it because Gary not using simple TY SPY price- LY SPY price. Anyway I cannot validate GEM performance as Gary suggested.\r\n\r\nAny idea ?"
